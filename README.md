Code from CS193P Course
=============

All the code samples in this repo are completely written by Paul Hegarty of Stanford University for demo during CS193P Winter 2015 Lectures. I don't deserve any credit for it. I have just downloaded from [CS193P official website](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/drupal/) and uncompressed and uploaded here for easier viewing and sharing.

CS193P is iOS Application Development course taught at Stanford by Paul Hegarty. Current course (winter 2015) covers iOS8 development using Swift and Xcode 6.
